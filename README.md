## Getting started

In the next steps you will setup the mumble chat app.

## Use credentials

We need a github token and a .npmrc to get access to the [mumble npm package](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah/pkgs/npm/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah) at [smartive education](https://github.com/smartive-education) on github.

Create github token and add to .npmrc

[Create a classic github token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

To authenticate by adding your personal access token (classic) to your ~/.npmrc file, edit the ~/.npmrc file for your project to include the following line, replacing TOKEN with your personal access token. Create a new ~/.npmrc file if one doesnâ€™t exist.

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
```

Create .npmrc and add following line

```bash
@smartive-education:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Add .env vars

I have sent you an email with the .env vars. Please copy them to the .env file in the root folder of the project.

## Install dependencies

Now we can install the dependencies.

From within the new folder, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
