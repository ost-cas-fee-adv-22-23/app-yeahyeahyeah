# Mumble Chat App

## Introduction

This is the final project for the 2nd part of the **Frontend Engineering Advanced** course, offered by the **University Ost** in Rapperswil.

We had to develop a **Chat App** based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) in a given **Mumble Design** according to the specification of [Mumble-Figma-Design](https://www.figma.com/file/nsXR2h0KwciWpuwKRD58FX/Mumble?node-id=437-1018). We had the requirement to use our previously developed [Component Library](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah) for our **Chat App**.

## Getting started

In the next steps you will setup the chat app.

### Prerequisites

#### NODE

Please use node version **16.19.1**. If you use _nvm_ you can use the following command.

```shell
nvm use 16.19.1
```

## Add credentials

We need a github token and a .npmrc to get access to the [mumble npm package](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah/pkgs/npm/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah) at [smartive education](https://github.com/smartive-education) on github.

Create github token and add to .npmrc

[Create a classic github token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

To authenticate by adding your personal access token (classic) to your ~/.npmrc file, edit the ~/.npmrc file for your project to include the following line, replacing TOKEN with your personal access token. Create a new ~/.npmrc file if one doesnâ€™t exist.

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
```

Create .npmrc in the project folder, where you wanna add your npm package and add following line

```bash
@smartive-education:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Add .env vars

Create a new _.env_ file in the root directory. I have sent you an email with the _.env_ vars. Please copy them into the newly created _.env_ file.

Now, you should be able to start the application.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartive-education/app-yeahyeahyeah.git

cd app-yeahyeahyeah

npm install
```

## Start the app

### Development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

```bash
npm run build

npm start
```

## Testing

### Unit testing with jest and react-testing-library

Run tests in watch mode

```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests once

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

Run tests in silent mode (without warnings)

```bash
npm run test:ci-silent
```

Run tests once with coverage report

```bash
npm run test:ci-coverage
```

Run tests in debug mode

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

### E2E testing with playwright

Before the first run, you have to install the default browsers for playwright.

```bash
npx playwright install
```

Now you can run the tests.

Run tests in headless mode

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run tests in headful mode

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headful
```

## Docker

Test the docker image locally.

## Features

The application is equipped with the following features.

- Almost real-time feeling, thanks to SWR. :)
- Write messages (mumble) with text and an image (optional).
- Search detail page, where you can navigate through #hashtags.
- Rate messages with a like.
- Comment on existing messages.
- Delete your own messages as needed.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo at [www.mumble-yeahyeahyeah.ch](https://www.mumble-yeahyeahyeah.ch). Please note that you must have a valid and active account on [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/).

## Terraform

### Plan

You can use this command to check whether the proposed changes match what you expected before you apply the changes or share your changes with your team for broader review.

```bash
terraform plan
```

`-out=FILENAME` - Writes the generated plan to the given filename in an opaque file format that you can later pass to terraform apply to execute the planned changes, and to some other Terraform commands that can work with saved plan files.

```bash
terraform plan -out=FILENAME
```

### Apply

When you run terraform apply without passing a saved plan file, Terraform automatically creates a new execution plan as if you had run terraform plan, prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions.

You can pass the -auto-approve option to instruct Terraform to apply the plan without asking for confirmation.

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Google Cloud

#### Create secret manager and secret

Go to google cloud and create a new secret manager. Then create a new secret with the name `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and add the secret value and add a new version.

#### Add needed permissions

Permission "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" is needed to access the secret manager. Add this role to "google_project_iam_member" "cloud-runner". Following code snippet shows how to add the role.

```terraform
resource "google_project_iam_member" "cloud-runner" {
  for_each = toset([
    "roles/run.serviceAgent",
    "roles/viewer",
    "roles/storage.objectViewer",
    "roles/run.admin",
    "roles/cloudsql.client",
    "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor",
  ])
  role    = each.key
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.cloud-runner.email}"
  project = data.google_project.project.id
}
```

#### Create resource "google_secret_manager_secret"

Create a new resource "google_secret_manager_secret" and add the secret.

```terraform
resource "google_secret_manager_secret" "default" {
  secret_id = "NEXTAUTH_SECRET"

  replication {
    user_managed {
      replicas {
        location = local.gcp_region
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Access the secret in the cloud run service

Access the secret and add it to the cloud run service. The example shows also how to add non secret environment variables to the cloud run service.

```terraform
resource "google_cloud_run_service" "app-yeahyeahyeah" {
  name                       = local.name
  location                   = local.gcp_region
  autogenerate_revision_name = true

  template {
    spec {
      containers {
        image = "europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/casfea22/app-yeahyeahyeah-docker/app-yeahyeahyeah"

        resources {
          limits = {
            "memory" = "256Mi"
            "cpu"    = "1"
          }
        }

        env {
          name = "NEXTAUTH_URL"
          value = "https://app-yeahyeahyeah-cbvb5d3h6a-oa.a.run.app"
        }

        env {
          name = "NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
          value_from {
            secret_key_ref {
              name = google_secret_manager_secret.default.secret_id
              key = "1"
            }
          }
        }

        env {
          name = "ZITADEL_ISSUER"
          value = "https://cas-fee-advanced-ocvdad.zitadel.cloud"
        }

        env {
          name = "ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID"
          value = "181236603920908545@cas_fee_adv_qwacker_prod"
        }

        ports {
          name           = "http1"
          container_port = 3000
        }
      }

      service_account_name = google_service_account.cloud-runner.email
    }
  }

  traffic {
    percent         = 100
    latest_revision = true
  }
}
```

#### Hints

##### Rename service

If you rename the name of the service, you will have to delete the actual state value ("casfea22-tf-state") in the bucket, otherwise terraform will not be able to create the service again. Following code snippet shows the name of the service, that has to be changed.

```terraform
locals {
  name       = "app-yeahyeahyeah"
  gcp_region = "europe-west6"
}
```
