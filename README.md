# Mumble Chat App

## Introduction

This is the final project for the 2nd part of the **Frontend Engineering Advanced** course, offered by the **University Ost** in Rapperswil.

We had to develop a **Chat App** based on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) in a given **Mumble Design** according to the specification of [Mumble-Figma-Design](https://www.figma.com/file/nsXR2h0KwciWpuwKRD58FX/Mumble?node-id=437-1018). We had the requirement to use our previously developed [Component Library](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah) for our **Chat App**.

## Getting started

In the next steps you will setup the chat app.

### Prerequisites

#### NODE

Please use node version **16.19.1**. If you use _nvm_ you can use the following command.

```shell
nvm use 16.19.1
```

## Add credentials

We need a github token and a .npmrc to get access to the [mumble npm package](https://github.com/smartive-education/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah/pkgs/npm/design-system-component-library-yeahyeahyeah) at [smartive education](https://github.com/smartive-education) on github.

Create github token and add to .npmrc

[Create a classic github token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

To authenticate by adding your personal access token (classic) to your ~/.npmrc file, edit the ~/.npmrc file for your project to include the following line, replacing TOKEN with your personal access token. Create a new ~/.npmrc file if one doesnâ€™t exist.

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
```

Create .npmrc in the project folder, where you wanna add your npm package and add following line

```bash
@smartive-education:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Add .env vars

Create a new _.env_ file in the root directory. I have sent you an email with the _.env_ vars. Please copy them into the newly created _.env_ file.

Now, you should be able to start the application.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartive-education/app-yeahyeahyeah.git

cd app-yeahyeahyeah

npm install
```

## Start the app

### Development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

```bash
npm run build

npm start
```

## Features

The application is equipped with the following features.

- Almost real-time feeling, thanks to SWR. :)
- Write messages (mumble) with text and an image (optional).
- Search detail page, where you can navigate through #hashtags.
- Rate messages with a like.
- Comment on existing messages.
- Delete your own messages as needed.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo at [www.mumble-yeahyeahyeah.ch](https://www.mumble-yeahyeahyeah.ch). Please note that you must have a valid and active account on [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/).

## Testing

### Unit testing with jest and react-testing-library

Run tests in watch mode

```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests once

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

Run tests in silent mode (without warnings)

```bash
npm run test:ci-silent
```

Run tests once with coverage report

```bash
npm run test:ci-coverage
```

Run tests in debug mode

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

### E2E testing with playwright

Before the first run, you have to install the default browsers for playwright.

```bash
npx playwright install
```

Now you can run the tests.

Run all tests in headless mode:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run tests in headful mode

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headful
```

#### Prerequisites to running e2e tests locally

To run the tests, the next instance must be running. So please run:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

All end-to-end tests can be initiated locally in isolation. It is recommended to use only one browser at a time. However, a test message must be created as a precondition. Use the following command to create a test message.

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should post a message with image' --project=chromium
```

Alternatively, the debug mode can be used. After each command the --debug option is applied for this purpose.

Now you have the possibility to perform all further tests.

#### Comment an article

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should comment an article' --project=chromium
```

#### Like an article

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should like it or not' --project=chromium
```

#### Click on hashtag

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should click on hashtag' --project=chromium
```

#### Should post no message

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should post no message' --project=chromium
```

#### Should list created message and liked article

```bash
npx playwright test -g 'should list created message and liked article' --project=chromium
```

#### The following browsers are available for e2e-tests:

- Chromium
- Firefox
- Webkit
- Mobile Chrome
- Mobile Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome

Apply this command to switch the browser. Here is an example for the Edge browser:

```bash
npx playwright test --project='Microsoft Edge'
```

### Reliability tests

We perform 6 hourly testing with Playwright to check endpoints for availability. The app that is installed on Google Cloud is checked. Additionally, the Qwacker API posts are tested for availability. The availability test can be executed directly with this command:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium -g '@healthcheck' --config=./playwright.checks.config.ts
```

### User testing

User testing was performed for this application. The testing was done by a 15 year old girl with basic computer skills. As a result, it was concluded that the image upload needs to be improved. The user test can be viewed here: [Mumble App - User Testing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kvJjgmPnBgXk69_TPcuVk6CGFh5JfceadXYyP-KSRdo/edit?usp=drive_link 'Mumble App - User testing').

## Docker

Test the docker image locally.

### Local

#### Build

```bash
docker build -t app-yeahyeahyeah . --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=$NPM_TOKEN
```

#### Run

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --rm --name app-yeahyeahyeah app-yeahyeahyeah
```

#### Google Cloud

#### Build

Hint: If you build the image on a mac with an M1 chip and you wanna use the image for example on a linux/amd64 machine,
you should use the `--platform=linux/amd64` flag in your Dockerfile to build the image for this specific platform.

```bash
docker build -t europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/casfea22/app-yeahyeahyeah-docker/app-yeahyeahyeah . --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=$NPM_TOKEN
```

### Run

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --rm --name app-yeahyeahyeah europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/casfea22/app-yeahyeahyeah-docker/app-yeahyeahyeah:latest
```

### Push

```bash
docker push europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev/casfea22/app-yeahyeahyeah-docker/app-yeahyeahyeah
```

## Google Cloud

Here are a few steps, if you want to deploy the application on Google Cloud.

### Create a new project

First of all you have to create a new project.

```bash
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID --name=PROJECT_NAME --set-as-default
```

### Enable billing

Next you have to enable billing for your project, otherwise you can't use any services.

```bash
gcloud beta billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
```

### Enable APIs

You will have to enable a few APIs for your project. Below are some of them listed. Maybe there are more APIs that you have to enable.

```bash
gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudapis.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable clouddeploy.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
```

### Create cloud storage bucket

The storage bucket is in our case used for the terraform state.

```bash
gsutil mb -p PROJECT_ID -c STANDARD -l europe-west6 -b on gs://BUCKET_NAME
```

### Secret Manager

With the Secret Manager you can store your secrets in a secure way. Below is an example how you can create a secret. You can also use the UI to create a secret. In the Terraform section you can see how to read these secrets.

#### Create secret

```bash
echo -n "SUPERSECRET" | gcloud secrets create "nextauth_secret" \
    --data-file - \
    --replication-policy "automatic"
```

## Terraform

With our terraform configuration, we can create a new project on Google Cloud and deploy our application. First you have to install terraform on your machine.

### Init

```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan

You can use this command to check whether the proposed changes match what you expected before you apply the changes or share your changes with your team for broader review.

```bash
terraform plan
```

`-out=FILENAME` - Writes the generated plan to the given filename in an opaque file format that you can later pass to terraform apply to execute the planned changes, and to some other Terraform commands that can work with saved plan files.

```bash
terraform plan -out=FILENAME
```

### Apply

When you run terraform apply without passing a saved plan file, Terraform automatically creates a new execution plan as if you had run terraform plan, prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions.

You can pass the -auto-approve option to instruct Terraform to apply the plan without asking for confirmation.

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Secret Manager

With the Secret Manager you can store your secrets in a secure way. Below is an example how you can create a secret. You can also use the UI to create a secret.

#### Create secret

```bash
echo -n "SUPERSECRET" | gcloud secrets create "nextauth_secret" \
    --data-file - \
    --replication-policy "automatic"
```

#### Add needed permissions

Permission "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" is needed to access the secret manager. Add this role to "google_project_iam_member" "cloud-runner". Following code snippet shows how to add the role.

```terraform
resource "google_project_iam_member" "cloud-runner" {
  for_each = toset([
    "roles/run.serviceAgent",
    "roles/viewer",
    "roles/storage.objectViewer",
    "roles/run.admin",
    "roles/cloudsql.client",
    "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor",
  ])
  role    = each.key
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.cloud-runner.email}"
  project = data.google_project.project.id
}
```

#### Access the secret

To access a secret from Google Secret Manager, use `the google_secret_manager_secret_version data` source:

```terraform
data "google_secret_manager_secret_version" "nextauth_secret" {
  provider = google

  secret  = "nextauth_secret"
  version = "1"
}
```

#### Print value of the secret

```terraform
output "secret" {
  value = data.google_secret_manager_secret_version.my-secret.secret_data
}
```

### Hints

##### Rename service or delete service

If you rename the name of the service or delete the service and create a new one, you will have to delete the actual state value ("casfea22-tf-state") in the bucket. Following code snippet shows the name of the service, that has to be changed.

```terraform
locals {
  name       = "app-yeahyeahyeah"
  gcp_region = "europe-west6"
}
```

You will also have to delete the service account, because the service account will be created during the first terraform run and will not be deleted if you rename the service.

##### Service account for terraform deployment

If you deleted the service account, or you want to create a new one with terraform, you will have to add the following roles to the service account.

Necessary permissions for the service account that is used for terraform deployment.

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding casfea22 \
--member='serviceAccount:casfea22-service-account@casfea22.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role='roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin'
```

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding casfea22 \
--member='serviceAccount:casfea22-service-account@casfea22.iam.gserviceaccount.com' \
--role='roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin'
```

## Github Actions

### Authentication

We use the Github Action auth with Workload Identity Federation to authenticate with Google Cloud.

Workload Identity Federation is recommended over Service Account Keys as it obviates the need to export a long-lived credential and establishes a trust delegation relationship between a particular GitHub Actions workflow invocation and permissions on Google Cloud.

You will find a lot of examples at their [google-github-actions repo]](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#setup).

#### Authentication with Workload Identity Federation

1.  Create a Google Cloud service account and grant IAM permissions
1.  Create and configure a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub
1.  Exchange the GitHub Actions OIDC token for a short-lived Google Cloud access
    token

### Prerequisites

- For authenticating via Workload Identity Federation, you must create and
  configure a Google Cloud Workload Identity Provider. See [setup](#setup)
  for instructions.

- You must run the `actions/checkout@v3` step _before_ this action. Omitting
  the checkout step or putting it after `auth` will cause future steps to be
  unable to authenticate.

- If you plan to create binaries, containers, pull requests, or other
  releases, add the following to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidentially
  committing credentials to your release artifact:

  ```text
  # Ignore generated credentials from google-github-actions/auth
  gha-creds-*.json
  ```

- This action runs using Node 16. If you are using self-hosted GitHub Actions
  runners, you must use runner version [2.285.0](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)
  or newer.

### Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Add intended permissions.
    permissions: write-all

    steps:
      # actions/checkout MUST come before auth
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - id: 'auth'
        name: 'Authenticate to Google Cloud'
        uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: 'projects/655814648425/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/casfea22-pool/providers/casfea22-provider'
          service_account: 'casfea22-service-account@casfea22.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
          token_format: 'access_token'

      # login to Artifact Registry
      - name: Login to Google Artifact Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: europe-west6-docker.pkg.dev
          username: 'oauth2accesstoken'
          # Use the access token from the auth step
          password: '${{ steps.auth.outputs.access_token }}'
```

Note that changing the `permissions` block may remove some default permissions.
See the [permissions documentation][github-perms] for more information.
